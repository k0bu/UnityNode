Option -g for "npm install" is to have the path accessible globally.
However, this means that when moving the directory to other environment,
you have to associate the path again for that new environemnt.
To get away with this problem, there is command in npm "npm run 'scriptname'".
Before using this, you must have written a line in package.json to be able to use this.
